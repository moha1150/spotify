Spotify API

This is code for an app that makes API calls to the Spotify API to perform various actions, such as returning a list of playlists, devices, and tracks, as well as controlling playback (e.g. play, pause, next, previous).

The app includes functions that use the fetch function to make requests to the Spotify API, passing in the necessary headers (e.g. Authorization, Content-Type) and any required parameters in the request body. The response is then parsed as JSON and the data is either displayed or used to perform a specific action (e.g. starting playback, skipping to the next track).

The HTML and CSS provided were for a simple user interface that includes a search field and buttons for searching for an artist, getting the user's playlists, devices, and player state, and controlling playback (e.g. play, pause, next, previous). It also includes a display area for the artist name and image.

To use this app, you will need to sign up for a Spotify Developer account and obtain a client ID and client secret. You will also need to enable the Authorization Code Flow for your app in the Spotify Developer Dashboard and set the redirect URI to the URL where your app is hosted.
